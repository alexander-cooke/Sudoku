To horizontally center a block element (like a div), use margin: auto
The width can then be expressed as a percentage.
For example, when the following class is attached to an element, it'll be centered in the middle 80% of the screen
.center {
  margin: auto;
  width: 80%;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
  padding: 10px;
}
